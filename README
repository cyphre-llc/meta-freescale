Some SoC depends on libraries and packages that are covered by
Freescale EULA. To have the right to use those binaries in your images
you need to read and accept the EULA at EULA.txt file.

In order to accept it, you should add, in your local.conf file:

ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1"

optionally include a branch if the patch applies to multiple branches,
otherwise master is assumed

git.yoctoproject.org vs. git.freescale.com:
-------------------------------------------

git.yoctoproject.org hosts the official upstream work of Freescale's OE/YP repos,
for official SDK releases at times we need to do last minute fixes or include things
not supported upstream so we have a different repo on git.freescale.com for the
official release. git.freescale.com should be based off repos from git.yoctoproject.org
